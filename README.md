# dsprojects 

dsprojects is a repository designed to explore data science topics through theoretical and application-based walkthroughs in Jupyter notebooks where I use curated problems to illustrate the principles of data science.  

I plan to cover fundamentals of statistical thinking and machine learning (tensorflow and keras)
